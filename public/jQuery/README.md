## Assessment
* Attendance record represent 33% of the course mark
* Homework assignment indicate student skills
* Skills represent 66% of the course mark
* Progress of assessed skills will be provided via Slack direct message
* Sample message [[2, 3], [4, 5]]
	* **Two** points earned out of a sub-total of **three** on one homework assignment
	* **Four** points earned out of a sub-total of **five** on two homework assignment
* Use [assessment.js](../../src/js/assessment.js) to previous course mark
	* Homework example `calculatePercent([[2, 3], [4, 5]])` (result 75%)
	* ... with 80% attendance `getJqueryCoursePercent(75, 80)` (result 77%)
* Homework is evaluated at the beginning of class. If you arrive after the class homework has been verified you will receive a zero mark for that assignment. An alternative for tardy arrival is to Slack your homework before class using a code sharing tool:
	* Commit homework to [your private GitHub.com repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/)
	* [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).
	* [Codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/)
	* Send static files through Slack's private message
